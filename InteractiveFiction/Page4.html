  <h1>Intervention</h1>

<p>
You took in their words while trying to hold it together. You waited for more truths but they never came. It made sense. They basically told you to throw away your identity. At least for a little while. Just considering made the void in your chest grow larger. “Is this what I wanted?” you thought to yourself. You tried. You really did. Your “job” was nothing more than the expectations of others pushing you. You don’t expect that part to change. You acknowledged that you at least had a moral obligation to care for others but struggled to fit in the obligation to care for yourself. Maybe you could make it work. Maybe not. It didn’t erase your mistakes. It didn’t resurrect the dead innocents. It won’t pay for the damages. What the conversation did do was give you some comfort in knowing you didn’t fail some higher power by keeping yourself curled up in your bed.

You heard your friend say a few more things but none could reach where your mind has gone. They gave you one last hug before leaving with a sad but friendly smile. You were a hungover mess in need of a shower. Maybe tomorrow you would get started on cleaning your room but today were tired. The people may not forgive you regardless of your decision but at least you could learn to love yourself again. Slowly, of course. For a person who could leap buildings, it was essential that you took baby steps.
