“Screw fate!” your friend exclaimed. “It’s not your job to keep the peace.” they finished while hoping their words made an impact. “Don’t say tha-” you said before being cut off. “I’ll say it again if I have to.” You were startled by their sudden outburst but you noticed that they were reeling themselves back in. “While I do think someone else will answer the call, let’s say that you’re right and it is your destiny. How can you expect to keep the peace if you’ve yet to find it yourself?”

You knew they were right in a way. The fear of failure and the weight of the world may have finally gotten to you. What could be done though? Stresses like these don’t just go away. How could anyone cope with this? Your friend broke the silence again. “Everyone wants to make an impact. Change the world if you will. If you want to change the world I suggest you start small. I would suggest taking an extended break that doesn’t involve you rotting away in this hole you call home. I want you to ask if being a hero is want you to want to be. Expectations be damned.”
