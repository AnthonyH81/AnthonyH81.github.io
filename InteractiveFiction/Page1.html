  <h1>Intervention</h1>



<p>You wake to the sound of your doorbell ringing. You didn’t know what it was at first due to your just-woke-up confusion. Or maybe it was because you didn’t want to get out of bed. These last few weeks have not been the best for you. You were a “gifted” individual destined for greatness. At least that’s what everyone told you when your abilities manifested. You trained from a young age in hopes of being the very thing this world needed: a symbol of strength, hope, and peace.
</p>

<p>
It was an impossible task but you someone had to do it. Things went well for a time. Even managed to make a name for yourself and others gave you nothing but praise. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. Your performance has been lacking. There was an uptick in criminals escaping capture, property damage, and even loss of life under your watch. People are allowed an occasional failure but this has been weeks worth of disappointment after disappointment. You knew who was at the door. It was a friend coming to crash your one-man pity party.</p>
