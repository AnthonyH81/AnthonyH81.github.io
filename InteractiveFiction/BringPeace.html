“Thing’s weren't all that bad at first. Sure, it was a hard job and it demanded so much of my attention, but it had to be done. So many people told me that I could change the world. When people looked up to me I looked towards the stars. That's because this wasn’t just a calling. It was destiny. Then enters a string of failures that made a stressful job even more so. All this power and potential and yet people aren't just dying, they’re dying because of me.” You said as the words poured out of you. Sometimes, talking to someone is all that’s needed for tension to be released. “I want to get back into it,” you sighed. “But I’m afraid of hurting more people and I don’t know who I am if I’m not keeping the peace, you know?”
