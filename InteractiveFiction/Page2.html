You heard your name called as you spaced out. Getting lost in your thoughts would be fun if it didn’t result in you being painfully aware of your emotions. You looked in their general direction but made it your duty to not make eye contact. “Sorry,” you said calmly. “ I’m here.” They placed their hand on your shoulder in a comforting manner. They did so slowly as to not startle you. “I know these last few weeks have been tough,” they started. “But pushing people away and hiding out in your home is no way to deal with your problems.”</p>
