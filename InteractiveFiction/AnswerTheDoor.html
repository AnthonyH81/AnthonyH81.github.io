  <h1>Intervention</h1>



<p>
The doorbell sounded through your home again and caused you to scream internally. “Fine!” you groaned as the good person in you took over. The mere act of getting out of bed made your mood worse. You weren’t the lazy type, you reasoned. You just lacked the will to exist outside your bedroom. After you made your way to the front door, a wave of light filled the corridor as you opened. It was blinding enough to make you look more irritated than ever but not enough to bleed over the face of your friend. Their face wore a look of worry that only became more pronounced as you greeted them. There was something else too, though. Even with the sun attacking your eyes, you could see the determination in theirs. Your observation was proven correct as they walked right past you and headed towards your living room. “No, by all means, come in,” you said sarcastically under your breathe.
