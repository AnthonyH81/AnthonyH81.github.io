“Then don’t go back.” your friend said empathetically. “You weren’t born just to help people. You weren’t born solely to be a savior. You can do other things. Do you want to know why?” They paused, thus allowing you to nod. “You are worth so much more than what you can do for others. You can do things most of us could only dream of. You’re one of the bravest and strongest people I know. But goddammit, if you go back like this, you will tear yourself apart.”

They were right and it burned like a hand on a hot stove. You put the needs of others before your own. You had to. You had the power to protect the weak so innocent people didn’t get hurt. Now you weren’t so sure. Your friend broke the silence again. “You are a kind soul. You’ve given this world everything. You’ve given us your joy, your peace of mind, and your love. Don’t you think it’s time you kept some of that for yourself? The suffering of others doesn’t have to be swapped out with your own. Sure, you made a couple of mistakes but you deserve those things just as much as anyone else.”
