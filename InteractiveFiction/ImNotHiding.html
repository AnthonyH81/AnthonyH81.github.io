As much as you wanted to sit there in silence, you knew you had to respond somehow. “I’m not hiding. There’s nothing wrong with having a little space, you know. I just needed some ‘me time.’” There was some truth to that statement. “‘Me time!?’” they said with a bit too much surprise than intended. “I’m sorry, but ‘me time’ usually involves some amount of self-care. Instead of me walking in to see that you’ve found Shangri-la, I find you looking like a wreck and smelling like a bar.” They were right about the last part at least. You didn't think a perfect world existed or if it ever could. However, bringing the world one step closer to perfect was part of the job. You couldn’t help but feel like you’ve made things worse. You feel the hand on your shoulder move in circles as they begin to look you in the eye, much to your discomfort. “Tell me,” they said. “What’s going on in that little head of yours?”
